# Distinguishing feature analysis of star classification (Spring 2023)

Please note that the star type, denoted as integers, are translated as the following:
- Brown Dwarf -> Star Type = 0
- Red Dwarf -> Star Type = 1
- White Dwarf -> Star Type = 2
- Main Sequence -> Star Type = 3
- Supergiant -> Star Type = 4
- Hypergiant -> Star Type = 5

---

The standard diagram used to display the categories of stars is the 
Hurtzsprung-Russell (or HR) diagram which plots temperature against luminosity of a star. It is shown below for the given dataset.

## How to create your solution repo **(COMPLETE STEPS #1 and #2 BEFORE YOU SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION, AND PUT THE LINK IN THE APPLICATION)**

1. [Create a **public** fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and name it  `ACM-Research-coding-challenge-23S` (click the "Fork" button in the top right).

2. Put the link to your fork in your ACM Research application in the question where it asks to do so. **This can just be a empty repo as you have until February 2 to work on your coding challenge in this repository**

3. Replace this README file with a description ([written in Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)) of your solution. Regardless of your success, describe the problem you set out to solve and how you did it. Split it up into sections with headers, and, if relevant, include figures.

4. Make sure to include all relevant files in your fork. If you made the project in a Kaggle notebook, click **File** â†’ **Download Notebook** to download it as an `.ipynb` file.

4. You may have to "clone" the fork you made to edit files locally on your computer and "push" them to GitHub. Learn how to do that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

5. Make sure your GitHub repo has everything important, including your report, any code you used, graphs, etc. You should not be working on this after the deadline (Feb 2).


## No collaboration policy

**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.** You _are_ allowed (and encouraged) to use internet documentation. If you use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources), **please cite your sources in the README**.

## Timing

Please don't spend too long on this project: **60 to 90 minutes** is reasonable. It's okay to put more time into your submission than that, but we don't expect you to get that much done; we really don't want this challenge to be a burden!

If you're *completely new* to this kind of project, however, it will likely take you more than 90 minutes. This is a *densely useful* project to go through (you will learn a lot), so we believe this is justified.

## Assessment criteria

Submissions will be evaluated holistically, in combination with the rest of your application. We will consider your effort, use of external resources, how you approached the problem, and presentation, among other considerations.

## Support and questions

Feel free to ask for clarifications in the #research-qna channel in the [ACM UTD Discord server](https://discord.gg/nJxRdKdG4d)! You can also directly message ACM Research Co-Directors Pranav Nair or Sisi Aarukapalli-Rose on the ACM Discord server.
